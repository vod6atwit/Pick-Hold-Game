## Game Rule

On a turn, a player rolls the die ðŸŽ² repeatedly. <br />The goal is to accumulate as many points as possible, adding up (hold) the numbers rolled on the die ðŸŽ².<br />However, if a player rolls a 1, the player's turn is over and any points they have accumulated during this turn are forfeited.
<br />Rolling a 1 doesn't wipe out your entire score from previous
turns, just the total earned during that particular roll. <br />A
player has to choose to hold (stop rolling the die ðŸŽ²) if they do not
want to take a chance of rolling a 1 and losing all of their points
from this turn. <br />If the player chooses to hold, all of the points
rolled during that turn are added to his or her score. <br />When a
player reaches a total of 100 points, the game ends and that player is
the winner.<br /><br />
