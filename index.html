          <span style="font-size: 3rem">❓❓❓</span> <br />On a turn, a player
          rolls the die 🎲 repeatedly. <br />The goal is to accumulate as many
          points as possible, adding up (hold) the numbers rolled on the die 🎲.
          <br />However, if a player rolls a 1, the player's turn is over and
          any points they have accumulated during this turn are forfeited.
          <br />Rolling a 1 doesn't wipe out your entire score from previous
          turns, just the total earned during that particular roll. <br />A
          player has to choose to hold (stop rolling the die 🎲) if they do not
          want to take a chance of rolling a 1 and losing all of their points
          from this turn. <br />If the player chooses to hold, all of the points
          rolled during that turn are added to his or her score. <br />When a
          player reaches a total of 100 points, the game ends and that player is
          the winner.<br /><br />
          GOOD LUCK <span style="font-size: 2.4rem">😎</span>
